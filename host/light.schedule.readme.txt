Light scheduling when automatic operation is used, will automatically adjust brightness of the connected LEDs.
During times where the time schedule does not define a light percentage or is empty, it will default to 100%.
When single digit, please also add an additional 0 (i.e 6 becomes 06).
The light schedule accepts syntax in the following format:

<hour> <minute> <second> to <hour> <minute> <second> <percent>
END

For example (lights at 50% from 1:30 PM UTC to 2:00 PM UTC):

13 30 00 to 14 00 00 50
END

Or (lights at 0% from 6:00 PM UTC to 6:00 AM UTC and lights at 80% from 6:00:1 AM UTC to 5:59:59 PM UTC):

18 00 00 to 6 00 00 0
06 00 01 to 17 59 59 80
END

If light schedule is not used, simply leave as:

END

Please note tht accepted times are read as UTC and are in 24 hr format.
